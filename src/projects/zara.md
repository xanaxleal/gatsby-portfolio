Zara has become one of the leading brands in the global retail industry. Part of its benefit is implemented by the image of the website, with a design that is closer to that of a magazine than an e-commerce  site, making the shopping experience an aspirational one. 

Our work as art directors is based on the selection of photographers, editorial design, video and motion design for the website and RRSS, improving the visual aspect of the product, allowing it to develop and exploit the potential of the product image through photography and video.
