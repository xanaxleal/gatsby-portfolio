El Corte Inglés luxury division, is another step in the internationalization of the brand and the expansion and upgrading of its services: a department store unique in Spain aimed at an exclusive audience of luxury consumers. 

In 2018, El Corte Inglés luxury embarked on an incredible brand renewal project, reaffirming its firm choices: a refined selection of brands for a luxury target. Visitors can access a new space dedicated to exclusive international brands in the heart of the city. Like other luxury brands, our starting point for creating the branding strategy began with the placement of the department stores on Calle Serrano. 

Through the history of the street and its numbers, we managed to build the Serrano universe structuring a 360º proposal of brand architecture that included campaigns, manual branding, rebranding and packaging.
