What determines the success of a club? Does it depend on a lot of people going or on lineup care? On speakers capable of generating seismic movements? 

At the end everything matters, but what happens when the promoters of the party are publicists and the place where you celebrate the party is the same place where Alfonso XIII watched porn films? That becomes an instant success. 

National Affairs, is the party of the summer, a breath of fresh air to so many repetitive offerings in the world of Madrid's nightlife. The legendary cock bar, where Susan Sontag left a graffiti on her door, Warren Beaty got drunk or Francis Bacon spent the last months of his life painting, opens its doors every summer to offer a selection of music and different people in one of the most exclusive settings in Madrid.
