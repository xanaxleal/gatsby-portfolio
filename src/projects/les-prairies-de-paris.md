[Les Praires de Paris](https://lesprairiesdeparis.com/ "Les Praires de Paris e-shop") is the personal endeavor of Laetitia Ivanes, artistic director of Galeries Lafayette's in-house women's ready-to-wear label since 2016. From 1996, notorious personalities such as Isabelle Huppert, Britney Spears and Léa Seydoux have visited their stores in Paris’ Saint Germain and Le Marais. 

For the launch of their first e-commerce website, we’ve created a narrative around the clothes that crystallizes in a short film revealed along a period of 4 weeks.
