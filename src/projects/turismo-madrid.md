Madrid is a city that receives 2,000,000 tourists a year. The cultural offer is unique to other European capitals, the best art gallery in the world, one of the best restaurants and good weather almost all year. These aspects and many others have favored the profileferation of a tourism phobia that makes many people from other communities are hesitant to visit Madrid. 

*"Community of Madrid, come back and meet me"*. A campaign that invites you to discover the corners of a community unknown to the majority of the public and that represents a more ecological and sustainable tourism alternative to that of the capital. 
A community where you can get lost through corners full of history.
