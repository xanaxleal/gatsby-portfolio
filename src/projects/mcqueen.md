[McQ](https://www.whomcq.com/ "McQueen film production company") is a film production company based both in Zurich and Berlin. 

For their website redesign they wanted to keep both teams together but not mixed up, which was the principle around we based our design. A subtle red thread guides the user’s way and divides the screen in two infinite scroll columns. That’s how we obtain an image-first experience and ease the way the user gets to the content.
