For Beefeater Pink, we created #MovimientoPink, a movement aimed at the generation known for trying to change everything they don’t like, the Millenials.

In the campaign we have the collaboration of pink-fluencers like Brays Efe, Gemma Galán, Víctor Palmero, Alex de Lucas, Mariona Terés and Ana Rujas who have given voice to #MovimientoPink, claiming everything that does not like and coloring it with Pink. For this movement, we had the collaboration of Meneo for which we created a reggaeton song that he later performed and became a summer hit.
