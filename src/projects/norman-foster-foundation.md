With this initiative, Norman Foster pretends to make available to young architects and researchers his vast archive. 

The large range of activities (Think tanks, conferences, workshopsâ€¦) offered in this website, lives along publications, multimedia resources and self initiated projects that he wants to separate from the work of his studio [Foster + Partners](https://www.fosterandpartners.com/ "Foster and Partners architectural design and engineering firm"). 

The design proposal for [this website](https://www.normanfosterfoundation.org/ "Norman Foster Foundation") takes literally the structure of a digital archive and makes it visible, in order to simplify the navigation across the multiplicity of contents.
