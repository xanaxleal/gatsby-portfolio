[Ponytale](https://www.ponytale-stories.com/ "Ponytale Magazine - Girl Culture") was created between Madrid and New York as a magazine whose main interest is the interpretation of contemporary female culture. 

Through the print publication and our online platform we supported the work of artists who portrayed their vision through photography, fashion or design. Ponytale has always been distinguished by a unique and controversial image that stood out from the rest of the magazines in the market. 

Due to its positioning as a young female magazine and its innovative design, each issue became a statement of avant-garde aesthetics and content. Thanks to the effort of the whole team we managed to sell in more than 12 different countries and consolidate ourselves as an underground girl's magazine.
