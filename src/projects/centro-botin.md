Spainâ€™s first building of Pritzker Prize winner Renzo Piano has become a landmark in Santander and the whole north of Spain. 

This art centre is the headquarters of the Botin Foundation and it expands their cultural work focused on art and creativity. This private art centre spans between the local impact of its educative program and the great international ambition of their its art program. 

This dualism was put on the centre of its brand strategy, described by the website [Underconsideration](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_centro_botin_by_2x4.php "Brand New, Underconsideration's blog on corporate and brand identity") as: *'a confident, contemporary identity with solid thinking of how it pairs with the building and the organization without being literal.'*
