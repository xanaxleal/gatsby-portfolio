[The Official Chamber of Architects of Madrid (COAM)](https://www.coam.org/ "COAM's website") recognises every year the best architectonic projects realised in the Community of Madrid with this prize. 

So for its tenth anniversary, we created a book that celebrated every awarded project in this period of time and an exhibition that takes this selection of projects as a literal continuous evolution.
